# 💳 Wiser – XRPL-Powered Payment Infrastructure

**Wiser** is a decentralized payment infrastructure built on the **XRP Ledger (XRPL)** that empowers users to spend their crypto assets like cash without losing custody. By combining **DIDs**, **on-chain KYC**, **XRPL pathfinding**, and the **Marqeta sandbox API**, users can generate a fully-functional **debit card** without needing to pre-fund it.

Wiser gives users seamless and cost-effective access to real-world payments using their crypto holdings.

## 💡 Inspiration

Our team constantly juggle between fiat and crypto, and we were inspired by the inefficiencies and centralization in most Web3-to-fiat bridges:

1. **Crypto enthusiasts** can’t swipe at most merchants without off-ramp hassles.  
2. Why must users **preload a custodial** wallet to spend crypto?  

> “What if spending crypto felt exactly like swiping a debit card while the conversion happened seamlessly in the background?”  

That question sparked Wiser.

## ❗ Problem Statement

> Most crypto-backed debit cards require users to **pre-fund** fiat into a separate account or custodial wallet. This results in:
- Loss of user custody and control
- Centralized risk and delayed transactions
- Broken user experience that feels disconnected from the real-time, on-chain world

## ⚙️ How Our Project Works

1. **Connect Wallet**  
   User connects their Crossmart wallet to Wiser’s platform.  
2. **KYC & DID Creation**  
   User have to complete KYC and generate a Decentralized Identifier (DID) on chain.  
3. **Request Debit Card**  
   User requests a virtual debit card generated from their wallet address, issued via the Marqeta sandbox API. 
4. **Initiate Payment at Merchant**
   User makes a purchase using the debit card at a regular merchant.
5. **Pathfinding & Conversion**
   Wiser triggers XRPL’s pathfinding algorithm to find the most efficient route to convert the selected token (FT) into USD.
6. **Just-in-Time Funding**
The converted USD amount is sent directly to Marqeta, funding the card just-in-time to complete the payment.
